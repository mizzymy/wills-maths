# Educational Framework: Implicit Learning Matrix

**Philosophy:** The math is the "ammunition" or the "key". Use the *speed* of recall to drive gameplay intensity.

## Curriculum Alignment (Ages 10-12)
Focus on **Fluency**, **Reasoning**, and **Problem Solving**.

| Game Module | Gameplay Action | Math Skill (Hidden) | Educational Goal (Curriculum) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Breach** | Rapidly identifying symbols to clear screen. | **Number Bonds & Subitizing** | Recall number pairs to 10/20/100 instantly. Mental addition/subtraction fluency. |
| **2. Neon Runner** | Choosing the correct path to maintain speed. | **Multiplication/Division Facts** | Recall multiplication tables up to 12x12. Identify factors and multiples. |
| **3. Black Market** | Buying/Selling items for profit. | **Arithmetic & Percentages** | Add/Subtract integers. Calculate simple percentages (10%, 50%) and profit margins. |
| **4. Encryption** | Completing the sequence to unlock. | **Linear Number Sequences** | Generate and describe linear number sequences. Find the term-to-term rule. |
| **5. The Heist** | Multi-stage boss mechanics. | **Mixed Application** | Apply all above skills under pressure (Time Management + Accuracy). |

## Difficulty Scaling (Adaptive Learning)
*   **Tier 1 (Rookie):** Single digit operations. Visual aids active.
*   **Tier 2 (Operative):** Double digits. Time pressure increased.
*   **Tier 3 (Elite):** Missing operatives (Algebraic thinking: `? + 5 = 12`). Complex sequences.

## Feedback Loop
*   **Mistake Handling:**
    *   *Bad:* "Wrong Answer." (Demotivating)
    *   *Good:* "Glitch Detected. System Instability." (Immersion) -> Show correct answer briefly as "Correction Protocol".
*   **After-Action Report:**
    *   Show "Accuracy Rating" (%).
    *   Highlight "Weakest Link" (e.g., "7x Table needs calibration").
