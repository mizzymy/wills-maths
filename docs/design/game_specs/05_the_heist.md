## 1. Core Gameplay Loop
1.  **The Opponent:** A giant "Security AI" avatar (The Warden, The Firewall, The Basilisk).
2.  **Turn-Based / Active Time Battle:**
    *   **Boss Attack:** The Boss charges a laser. "Solve 8+7 to blocks!"
    *   **Player Defense:** Tap `15` quickly to deploy a shield.
3.  **Player Phase:**
    *   "Charge Weapon": Solve 3 multiplication facts to load "Data Spikes".
    *   "FIRE": Tap to launch damage.
4.  **Victory:** Boss explodes in a massive cinematic event.

## 2. Dopamine Mechanics
*   **Health Bars:** Visually chipping away a massive health bar is incredibly satisfying.
*   **"Limit Break":** A special bar fills up. When full, "ULTIMATE HACK". The math slows down, you solve one complex problem, and deal massive damage.
*   **Epic Music:** Orchestral + Dubstep hybrid. Music swells as the boss gets to low HP.

## 3. Visual & Audio Targets
*   **Scale:** The boss takes up 50% of the screen.
*   **Impact:** Taking damage shakes the whole UI. Dealing damage flashes the screen white.

## 4. Educational Tuning

    *   Phase 1: Addition (Defense).
    *   Phase 2: Multiplication (Offense).
    *   Phase 3: Logic/Patterns (Finishing Blow).
