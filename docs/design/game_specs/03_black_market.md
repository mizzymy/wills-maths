# Game Specification: "Black Market"

**Role:** The "Strategy" / Arithmetic Trainer.
**Commercial Reference:** *Drug Wars* (Clean/Cyber version) / *Recettear*.
**Hook:** "Master the Deal."

## 1. Core Gameplay Loop
1.  **Context:** You are a fence moving "Data Chips", "Neural Links", and "AI Cores".
2.  **The Offer:** NPC Dealer: "Buying 5 Neural Links for 120 Bits total."
3.  **The Calculation:**
    *   You own them at base cost (e.g., 20 Bits each).
    *   Math: `5 * 20 = 100` (Cost). Offer is `120`. Profit = `20`.
4.  **Action:**
    *   **ACCEPT:** Quick swipe up. Cash sound.
    *   **REJECT:** Swipe down. "Lowball offer!"
    *   **HAGGLE:** (Math Minigame): Solve a precise sum to raise the price by 10%.

## 2. Dopamine Mechanics
*   **The "Ca-Ching":** The sound of making money must be incredibly satisfying. Coins cascading visually on screen.
*   **Rarity System:** Items have glows: Common (Grey), Rare (Blue), Legendary (Gold).
    *   Trading a "Legendary AI Core" triggers a special handshake animation.
*   **High Stakes:** Occasional "Whale" clients. "I need 50 units. 10,000 Bits."
    *   The math assumes urgency. Timer ticks down. Heartbeat SFX increases.

## 3. Visual & Audio Targets
*   **Aesthetics:** Gritty, dark alleyway background with holographic menus.
*   **UI:** Heavy, tactile buttons. Metal clinks when selected.
*   **Audio:** Ambient city noise (rain, sirens). Satisfying register drawer opening sound.

## 4. Educational Tuning
*   **Concepts:** Addition/Subtraction (Profit calculation), Division (Unit price), Percentages (Haggling).
